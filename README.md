This project performs exploratory data analysis and builds a
Decision Tree classifier to predict diabetes outcomes.

## Dataset
- Source: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset
- Target variable: Outcome (0 = Non-Diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

## Steps Performed
- Data exploration and visualization
- Feature/target separation
- Train-test split
- Decision Tree training
- Accuracy evaluation
- Tree visualization

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python model.py
